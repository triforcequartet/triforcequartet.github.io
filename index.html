He quickly developed a love for chamber music and joined a quartet coached by Helen Fall at age ten that he would remain in through high school. He has studied with leading members of the National Symphony Orchestra including Loran Stephenson and Yvonne Caruthers and also studied at different Chamber Music Camps across the Mid-Atlantic region. He studied under Carl Donakowski at James Madison University and graduated with a Bachelors in Music in 2007. At James Madison, he was the principal cellist in various orchestras, operas, and musicals, and in addition played with the Lexington Symphony from 2005-2010.</p>
<p>Chad’s passion for chamber music led him to the wedding and gig industry. He has performed in hundreds of weddings and other gigs over the last fifteen years working with Music By Anthem and Olivera Music Entertainment where he has performed a vast assortment of music genres. He also played in a string quartet aboard the Celebrity Infinity for four months in 2010. In addition, he has played live and recorded in a studio with different bands ranging from folk music with Brady Earnhart to modern rock with Spilling Dew, Remember Daylight, and Greasy Hands.</p>
<p>Chad is also an avid gamer. His favorite genres are Adventure, RPGs, Sports, Puzzle, and FPSs although he admits he kind of sucks at FPSs. His favorite games include Final Fanatsy VI, Chrono Trigger, NHL 94, Zelda: aLttP, Mario Galaxy 2, World of Goo, and countless others. In 2006, Chad arranged a quick Zelda medley for the encore of his senior recital at James Madison University. The video went viral as it was one of the only video game covers at the time. This led to him organizing what is now the Triforce Quartet. Chad is the founder, arranger, and operator of Triforce Quartet and owes his influences to his classical music training and the memorable themes from his favorite video games he played as a kid.</p> </div> </details> </article><article class="bio-card"> <img src="/bios/jacob-roege.jpg"> <h3 class="bio-name">Jacob Roege</h3> <p class="bio-position">Violin</p> <details class="bio-expand"> <summary>Read bio</summary> <div class="bio-content"> <p>Born in Okinawa, Japan to an Air Force family, Jacob spent his early childhood all around the world until his family settled in the Northern Virginia area.

While at Eastman, Stanley performed in several major solo and chamber music recitals and, in 2004, was selected to perform as an ensemble member in a gala performance under the direction of prominent 20th-century composer Krzysztof Penderecki. Stanley has studied with teachers George Taylor and Helen Fall and has had lessons with violists John Graham and Susan DuBois; master classes with prominent violists Roberto Diaz, Nokuthula Ngwenyama, and Jeffrey Irvine; and chamber music coachings with members of the Ying Quartet, Mikhail Kopelman, Annie Fullard, and Tracy Silverman.</p>
<p>A member of Triforce since January, 2014, Stanley is an occasionally avid gamer and e-sports enthusiast who takes his kitchen table Magic: the Gathering entirely too seriously. Raised on a steady diet of Civilization, Master of Orion, General Chaos, Sonic, Mario, Diablo, and Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Stanley spends most of his gaming time these days playing Diablo III and Magic. His twitch.tv favorites include Magic tournaments (go figure), League of Legends (Team Curse!), and StarCraft 2.</p> </div> </details> </article> </ul>  </section>   </main> <footer> <p>Copyright &copy; 2025 Triforce Quartet</p> <p>Site by <a href="#">Chris Rooke</a></p> </footer> </body></html>
