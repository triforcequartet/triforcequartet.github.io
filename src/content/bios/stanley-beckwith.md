Stanley Beckwith is a native of Fairfax, VA and is an active violist in the Washington, DC area.

Stanley received his Bachelor of Music from the prestigious Eastman School of Music (Rochester, NY) in 2009.

Stanley has studied with teachers George Taylor and Helen Fall and has had lessons with violists John Graham and Susan DuBois; master classes with prominent violists Roberto Diaz, Nokuthula Ngwenyama, and Jeffrey Irvine; and chamber music coachings with members of the Ying Quartet, Mikhail Kopelman, Annie Fullard, and Tracy Silverman.

A member of Triforce since January, 2014, Stanley is an occasionally avid gamer and e-sports enthusiast who takes his kitchen table Magic: the Gathering entirely too seriously. Raised on a steady diet of Civilization, Master of Orion, General Chaos, Sonic, Mario, Diablo, and Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Stanley spends most of his gaming time these days playing Diablo III and Magic. His twitch.tv favorites include Magic tournaments (go figure), League of Legends (Team Curse!), and StarCraft 2.
