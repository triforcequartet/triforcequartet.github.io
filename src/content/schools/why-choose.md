    ### Engaging & Accessible

    We speak the musical language students know and love. By pairing familiar tunes from The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Mario, and more with timeless classical works, we show how music connects across generations and styles. We help showcase the musical pieces behind the inspiration for known medleys, boss battles, TV, and movies.

    ### Educational Without Feeling Like Homework

    Our programs can cover music history, composition, and the art of live performance woven into stories, demonstrations, and Q&A sessions that keep kids interested and involved. We use hands-on learning to explore how music can impact how people feel as they journey through a video game or movie. Triforce Quartet members bring in their own experiences as professional performers and former college-level students to illuminate the power of playing string instruments. We strive to balance providing and workshopping around the technical pieces of music playing with the artful and personal ones.

    ### Flexible for All Ages & Skill Levels

    We tailor content for your audience including elementary students experiencing a string quartet for the first time, middle and high school musicians looking for inspiration, or campers exploring the performing arts. Our goal is to bring in elements of energy, inspiration, and laughter so every young learner comes away with having learned something new.
