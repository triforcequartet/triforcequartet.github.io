We understand wedding planning can be stressful, intimidating, or tiring. We know there are many decisions to make along the way and sometimes it’s a challenge to feel like everyone is on the same page. We want to help make this part of the planning easy, enjoyable, and meaningful. Our unique ability to offer a wide range of musical genre arrangements including classical, pop, rock, folk, and, of course, video game music allows you to craft the musical experience for your wedding that reflects each of you as individuals and as a couple. It can help smooth the wedding day transitions, bring people together, and help your guests feel connected to you.

Whether you’re envisioning a classic wedding ceremony or hoping to weave in the music from the games that bring on all the feels and nostalgia, Triforce Quartet creates a soundtrack that is as meaningful and unique as your love story.
