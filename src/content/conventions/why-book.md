    ### Authentic Fandom, Professional Musicianship

    Before we were musicians, we were gamers first. Our members battled bosses, opened treasure chests, and saved princesses before we mastered vibrato, harmonics, and ponticello. We string together our hard earned gaming experience and musical expertise to produce a nostalgic musical journey. Our deep identification with video game music means every arrangement is crafted with authenticity, care, and an understanding of the fan experience. Our classically trained musicians deliver top-tier talent to the stage with the energy and excitement your attendees will easily connect with.

    ### Perfect for Any Convention Setting

    Whether it’s a main stage concert, an intimate panel performance, or live background music in an artist alley or VIP lounge, Triforce Quartet adapts to fit your schedule and space. We’ve performed at fan conventions, anime expos, comic cons, gaming industry events, and even academic and orchestral showcases.

    ### Nationwide & Tour-Ready

    Based in the Washington, D.C. area, we travel across the country bringing epic performances to fans everywhere. Triforce Quartet is ready to work with your team to create a performance experience tailored to your event. We can (classically!) rock out as a headliner for an evening show, jam with other artists during a special guest appearance, speak about our craft as a featured panelist, or provide background music for varying events on the convention schedule. Our versatility in repertoire and experience invites creativity when planning an event.

    ### Customizable Setlists

    Want to feature music from specific games or themes? We offer flexible setlists to match your audience. From retro classics to modern epics, our library spans decades of gaming history. What’s even better? Most of our catalog of music selection has been arranged by us personally. We value being a part of each step of what our audience eventually hears at our shows. Triforce Quartet members are proudly involved in the inception, arrangement, production, and performance details of the music you and your guests hear.
